# Shopping-List-GUI
This project is very simple and easy to use. The whole point is that the you, the user, inputs items that you need to buy into this GUI. Once you are done with your list you click "Done" and the project will create a .txt File that shows everything that you want to buy. Once your done you can save the .txt file for later use. Enjoy
